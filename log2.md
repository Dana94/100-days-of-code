flower-slideshow

**Today's Progress**: Thanks to Bootstrap, I finally centered the main image. Now I'm configuring a button to change the gallery from grid to column format. The grid would show the images smaller but more to see in one view. The column would show them bigger, not all seen at once, and it would take up less room on the screen. The gallery images are filled using a function rather than directly into the html.

**Thoughts:** Every time I finish one part in this program, I suddenly come up with another function to try and implement. It's a good feeling.:)
