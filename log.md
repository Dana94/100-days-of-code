##### color-buttons program

**Today's Progress**: Clicking a button changes the background color of it. The color will be chosen by random RGB values. 

**Thoughts:** I wanted to do something that seemed pretty simple in my head, but I wanted to test myself to see how much of a struggle it would be. I was having some trouble in the end with setting the RGB values in the jQuery .css() method. It turns out I forgot the commas. :)

### Day 1: December 31, 2016 (Happy New Years!)
##### flip-book program

**Today's Progress**: I created a button that changes the image currently shown. Clicking it repeatedly will show a figure doing a jumping jack. Currently working on the other part of the program. It will have the user click on a button and the image will run as a flip book impression. The figure will appear to be jumping up and down until the button is pressed again.  

**Thoughts:** I am experimenting with event handlers since I know there is more than one way to use them. I need to fix the function for the start/stop button because there must be an easier way to identify what image is currently displayed in order to replace it with the other one. Maybe just put the values in an array to save typing them out? We'll see. I need to lengthen the time lapse between switching out the picture for the second button's function, else the user won't be able to see the figure doing the jumping jack.
