##### color-buttons program

**Today's Progress**: Clicking a button changes the background color of it. The color will be chosen by random RGB values. 

**Thoughts:** I wanted to do something that seemed pretty simple in my head, but I wanted to test myself to see how much of a struggle it would be for me I was having some trouble in the end regarding setting the RGB values in the jQuery .css() method. It turns out I forgot the commas. :)
